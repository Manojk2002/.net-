Basic of Computers : 
 Hardware and Software components

Role of Operating System : a) User Interface
                           b) Processor Management
                           c) Memory Management
                           d) File Management 
                           e) Interrupts Management
                           f) Security Management 
                           g) Device Driver Management 
                       
CPU : Central Processing Unit :
          Single Core
          Dual Cire
          Quad Core
          Multi Core
          
     
Various Types of Languages :

1.  Assembly Lang : Low level Lang, intended to communicate with the hardware directly
     Assembler : is a program that translates commands into machine code. They gather the instructions from the assembly and translate into a series of electrical signals
     Components :
       1. Syntax : basic structure
       2. Label : a word, number or a symbol, which can be used as a reference point to locate the instruction
       3. Command : an order
       4. Operand : Data manipulation
       5. Directive : instructions to change the settings or perform action
       6. Macro : short cut representation of a sequence of instructions
       7. Mnemonics : Represents abbreviations of the action being performed

Eg : MOV a, 10  --- registers 10 in a
     MOV 5 , b
     ADD a,b,c   --- add a with b and register it into c


2. Machine Lang : Every character in the keyboard will have an ascii number and it always occupies 1 byte 

    1 byte : 8 bits ( 1 bit is either a '0' or a '1')

00000000  -  stop the program
00000001  - switch on

Programming Languages :

a. Procedural Lang : A sequence of instructions in an order 
     C,C++
     Java
     Basic
     Pascal

b. Function Programming Lang : More focus is on the output of a mathematical calculation/evaluations
     Scala
     Erlang
     Python
     F#
     Elixir

c. OOP Lang : Treats a program as a group of objects composed of data and program elements (attributes and methods)
     C++
     Java
     C#
     Python
     Ruby

d) Scripting Lang : automates repetitive tasks, manages the dynamic content
     PHP
     JavaScript
     Perl
     Python
     Bash
     Node.js

e) Logic programming Lang : Instead of passing instructions as what to do, we express a series of facts and rules that will be interpreted by the system and gives out decisions
     Prolog
     Datalog
     Alma
     Absys

f) Front End Lang : mostly used for supporting UI/UX ( User Interface and User Experience), Images, colors, text, navigation)
      Html/Css
      JavaScript
      React Js
      Angular

g) Back End Lang : Deals with storage and manipulation of data (server side software). No direct interaction with the user
     JavaScript
     PHP
     Java
     C#

Application Development Models :
   1. Desktop applications/windows application
   2. Client/Server (2 tier, 3 tier, n tier)
   3. Web Model
